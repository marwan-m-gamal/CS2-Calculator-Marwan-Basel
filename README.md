This is a simple calculator project that performs multiple operations on one or two numbers depending on the type of operation.



To build the calculator, first place the calculator.cpp, calculator.h, and test.cpp files in one directory. 
Then inside that directory, create a new directory called build.
Inside build, run the command cmake ..
After that, run the command make.
Finally, run the program using ./program inside the build directory.
